Commentary
Woakes to Gayle, no run, starts with the shorter length on middle and leg, Gayle waits on the back foot and blocks to mid-wicket
0.1
Woakes to Gayle, no run, rapped on the pads but it's pitching outside leg and also a bit high too. Rose from a good length and straightened just a bit to beat Gayle who was trying to flick it away
0.2
Woakes to Gayle, no run, crackerjack of a ball! Traditional line and length from Woakes who delivers this on middle and off, on that good length with a hint of away movement. Gayle is stuck on the crease and has a mere push at it. Gets squared up totally and is fortunate to nick this. Unplayable stuff!
0.3
Woakes to Gayle, no run, fuller this time and Gayle is committed on the front foot this time, drives well to mid-off
0.4
Woakes to Gayle, no run, another unplayable nut from Woakes who is getting the ball to move. This one pitched around off stump and decked away late as Gayle played inside the line. To the big man's credit, he didn't go chasing at it
0.5
Woakes to Gayle, no run, angling across Gayle from a good length, a touch wider and he decides to let it pass. Maiden! Fine start from Woakes and now it shall be interesting to see what Archer gets out of this pitch with the new ball
0.6
Jofra Archer to Lewis, wide, starts with an erratic delivery, shorter length that's well down the leg-side
