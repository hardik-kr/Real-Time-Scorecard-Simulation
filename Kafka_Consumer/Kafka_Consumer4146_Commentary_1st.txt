Commentary
Starc to Mohammad Shahzad, no run, Shahzad gives the charge straightaway, good intent but Starc fires this very full and outside off. Pacy as well, dug out down the track
0.1
Starc to Mohammad Shahzad, no run, fuller once more, Shahzad is in two minds whether to play or leave. Ends up getting it off the bottom of the blade towards backward point
0.2
Starc to Mohammad Shahzad, out Bowled!! The stumps are in a mess! Nothing destructive than a pacy Starc inswinger and he gets this curve in sharply at high pace. Shahzad was stuck on the crease and tried to hoick across the line. Not the wisest option against a world class bowler and he misses it altogether. The woodwork is damaged and Australia have struck early here in Bristol wkt (1-0) min (4m). Mohammad Shahzad b Starc 0(3)
0.3
Starc to Rahmat, no run, shortens the length a wee bit and angles it across Shah who dabs it towards point
0.4
Starc to Rahmat, 3 runs, nice shot! The inswinger attempt from Starc but the line is a touch too straight this time and Shah eases the flick through the gap at mid-wicket. Finch from mid-on gives chase and hauls it back in with a slide. Parries it to his mate who wagged along, and although the parry wasn't great, they still save a single
0.5
Starc to Hazratullah Zazai, no run, leg stumpish and Zazai defends it solidly off the back foot
0.6
Pat Cummins to Rahmat, no ball, starts with an overstep, Cummins. Got this shape away nicely from a good length as Shah left it alone. Free Hit for Shah
