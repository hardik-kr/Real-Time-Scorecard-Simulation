0.2
Woakes to Finch, leg byes, 2 runs, half-an-appeal for LBW, but the angle was taking it down leg, tad fuller and shaping back into the right-hander, Finch fell across on the flick and missed, off the pads and behind square on the on-side for a couple of leg-byes

Woakes to Warner, no run, that's a good leave from Warner, on a good length and in that channel just outside off, a hint of shape back into the left-hander, Warner watched it all along, didn't cover his stumps fully as he let it go by. Didn't miss the off-stump by much

2.2
Woakes to Warner, no run, beauty, tad fuller from Woakes, but it isn't that full to make Warner play - looked good on replays, but Warner wasn't ever going to nick this - nipped away late and opened up Warner on the forward push, past the outside edge and through to the keeper
