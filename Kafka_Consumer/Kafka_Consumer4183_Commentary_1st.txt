Commentary
Santner to Roy, Byes, 4, whatta start! This delivery almost clipped the leg-stump. On any other day, it would have fetch Santner a wicket but Roy had luck on his side and he survives it. It was an arm ball, came back in viciously. Roy went for a cut. It missed his bat, missed stumps and evaded Latham too. It goes for a boundary
