Riaz to Rahim, out Bowled!! Ah, the idiosyncrasies of this Lord's wicket. 149ks angling away from a good length and Rahim thought he could easily run it down to third man with an angled bat face. Could be the pace of Riaz or could be the slope; it darts back ever so slightly, catches the inside edge and clatters into middle and off.

11.5

8.5
Shaheen Afridi to Shakib, 1 run, slight mix up but they abort the second run and rightly so. Would have been disastrous otherwise.

5.5
Amir to Soumya Sarkar, out Caught by Fakhar Zaman!! This is a fine catch! Fakhar at cover-point had to move across to his right quickly and grab this really low, inches above the ground. Did so perfectly. Amir deserved this wicket to be honest with the way he had been troubling Sarkar. Not a wicket-taking delivery as such though, kept it outside off on a length and tempted Sarkar to go for the uppish cut stroke. Fakhar did the rest in the inner ring wkt (1-26) min (20m). Soumya Sarkar c Fakhar Zaman b Amir 22(22) [4s-4]

Amir to Soumya Sarkar, FOUR, this is off the inside half of the blade but it races away well wide of mid-on and all the way to the fence. Sarkar starting to motor along now. This was the in-angler from Amir and the southpaw wanted to probably go straighter but couldn't middle it as well as he wanted. Won't mind the result though
5.1
Amir to Soumya Sarkar, no run, thick inside edge onto the back pad. The knuckle ball from Amir and Sarkar wanted to bludgeon the drive through the covers. Probably early into the stroke
4.6

3.5

3.4
Amir to Tamim, no run, edged but doesn't carry! Amir is certainly cranking it up here and getting some movement as well. Tamim's turn to get deceived, as he got a bottom edge on the drive due to the outward shape. Sarfaraz went one-handed to his left but it just bounced in front of him
3.3
Amir to Soumya Sarkar, 1 run, another thick edge but well short of third man! Sarkar is living dangerously here. Chases a wide delivery that's not as full as thought, and goes for a flashy drive. Miscues it completely but doesn't go to hand
3.2

2.6
Hafeez to Soumya Sarkar, FOUR, that's a moony ball from Hafeez! What a delivery! Probably slipped out of his hand and ended up as a slow mo high full toss that took forever to arrive. Reminded me of gully cricket for a while as Sarkar came down, waited, waited and then banged it over mid-wicket. Aerial but well wide of the man in the deep
2.5

2.1

1.6

1.5
Amir to Tamim, 1 run, a bit too straight in line, Tamim picks it off with a back foot flick behind square leg. Pakistan are officially eliminated from CWC 2019
1.4
Amir to Soumya Sarkar, 1 run, dropped! Sohail the culprit at first slip and this is a dolly really. Amir might be the unluckiest bowler going around, if we take the count of dropped catches off his bowling in recent years. Fourth stump line on a good length, hint of away shape as Sarkar poked at it. Got a healthy edge that went at a fair height and pace to Sohail who just spilled it
1.3
Amir to Soumya Sarkar, no run, beaten this time! Gets it closer to the off pole and straightens off the deck as Sarkar plays inside the edge
1.2
Amir to Soumya Sarkar, FOUR, just over the infield! There was an initial excitement from Amir but Sarkar gets lucky here. Wanted to drive on the up despite the length not being full enough and mistimed it completely. However, he got enough wood to get it over cover. Races away to the fence
1.1
Amir to Soumya Sarkar, 2 runs, very full but down the leg-side, Sarkar flicks it aerially behind square leg. Good running fetches a brace by the time fine leg gets across
0.6
Hafeez to Tamim, no run, sliding in from outside off, Tamim camps back and defends with a straight bat. Maiden!
0.5
